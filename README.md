At the bottom consists of the controls within the game. There may also be some cheat codes to better test the game. Feel free to use those freely if they are listed. <br />

*Has multiple videos explaining some smaller concepts when it comes to 2D programming that I learned and transferred into my gaem and expanded on those ideas* <br />

Controls: <br />
-Movement: A/S Keys <br />
-Attack: Enter <br />
-Jump: Space <br />
-Dash: Left Control *(Was originally Left Shift, but ran into Sticky Keys activating if attempted to be used too many times)* <br />


Cheats: <br />
*-List any cheats implemented here* <br />


Final Notes: <br />
*If there happens to be any bugs/visual bugs/recommendations that you come across while playtesting that I happened to miss myself, please let me know as I intend to continue programming/expanding this game in my off-time in the future. Thank you in advance!* <br />

*Below is a list of functions in the works "(in progress)" that haven't been fully implemented or ideas "(idea)" that I intend to start working on soon to implement into the game to make it better overall* <br />

Incomplete/In Progress Ideas: <br />
-Better movement around map, such as stairs and collision with dying enemies (in progress) <br />
-Traps such as spikes/blow dart arrows around map to make difficulty scale as you progress (idea) <br />
-As game becomes larger, possible save states based on room/health etc (idea) <br />
-Better attack registration delay/hit on enemies to match with animation (in progress) <br />
-More detailed background tilemaps (in progress) <br />
-Add blocking and health gaining functions for player (in progress) <br />
-Redo attack animations to include precise hitBoxes throughout the animation (in progress) <br />
-Adjustments/redo of animation triggers foir player/enemies to prduce much more fluent movement/animations (in progress) <br />
-Adjust movement for enemies to be able to scale stairs properly instead of getting stuck (in progress) <br />
